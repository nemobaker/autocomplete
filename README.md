# Front-end Challenges

## Autocomplete Challenge
Build a responsive web application in the framework of your choice that lets users search for a city in a provided list.

1. Capture key presses from a text input and use the current value of the input to match items in the list (shown below).
2. The application should output the results under the input field as soon as you type at least 3 characters.
3. If you type less than 3 characters in the text field, it should not output any results. (It can return a prompt to type more at least 3 characters)
4. If there are no results for the search, you should let the user know.
5. Search through this list for approximate matches. For example, if the user enters `san`, it should match `san`, `santiago`, `san francisco`, `santa rosa`, etc. If they enter `sant`, it should only match `santiago` and `santa rosa`.
6. When the page loads the search field should be selected automatically, so you can start typing (similar to when you go to https://www.google.com/).
7. The application should work well on desktop and mobile.

**The City List:**

```javascript
const cities = [
  'san', 'san jose', 'santiago', 'san francisco', 'santa rosa', 'san juan', 'sabadell', 'salamanca', 'salt lake city', 'salinas', 'salem', 'sausalito', 'taipei', 'tel aviv', 'tempe', 'termez', 'temuco', 'tiajuna', 'tieling', 'thousand oaks', 'thunder bay', 'tokyo', 'tulsa'
]
```

**DOM Assumptions:**

Work off of this HTML file and render the application into `#app-autocomplete`. You can add script and style tags as you want, we only care about `<div id="app-autocomplete"></div>` being in place.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Autocomplete</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="app-autocomplete"></div>
  <script src="app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>

</html>
```


### Requirements
- Provide a `README` file and add information on how to build and/or run the project locally. This file can also include your thought process and any explanation.
- Push the application to a public github repo and provide us with a link.

### Implementation
- If you want to, feel free to use any boilerplate projects and `gulp`, `grunt`, `webpack` that bootstap the project for you. But if you don't need it, you **don't have to add it, they're not part of the challenge**.
- If you are using any js processors, **include both source and distribution files**.
- Add some styles, make it look good.
- Do not cheat. There are lots of autocomplete projects out there, we're not interested in those. We want to see **how you think**.

### What we're evaluating
- Is there enough information for us to run the project?
- Does it work?
- How are the components structured?
- How clean is the code? (comments are good, explicit code is better)
- How does using it feel overall?

### Timeframe
We're expecting this will take you one or two evenings.
